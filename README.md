# ANSIKit

## A Call for help.

So, I need your help. This current implementation works, but it's horrible. It needs cleaning up and making it less of a memory and cpu hog than it currently is.

## Why

Log files are everywhere and if they are generated in a terminal (linux, unix, osx, otherwise) then they are more than likely to be ANSI formatted.

Displaying these text files in a app (iOS or OSX) is desirable, but first we need to extract them

## The Problem

This is HARD.

By HARD I mean, really, really, hard. I could use profanities but that would be pointless.

You get how hard this stuff is.

## How to help out

1. Fork the repo.
1. Clone the repo.
1. Create a branch.
1. Write a solution including tests.
1. Commit your code and push it up.
1. Submit a pull request.

## Thanks

Many thanks for your help and input. You are all awesome.
